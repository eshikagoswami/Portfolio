        <img src="IMG.jpg" alt="THIS IS ME">
        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Eshika Goswami, a passionate computer science student with a love for problem-solving and software development. Currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science at Graphic Era Hill University, I am dedicated to honing my skills in areas such as Java, C++, and algorithmic problem-solving.

            Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy in creative endeavors like painting and writing. I believe these activities not only enrich my life but also contribute to my holistic development as a budding software engineer.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>American Sign Language Detection:</strong>Translating sign language gestures from live videos into alphabets using OpenCV.This project concludes live video frames are successfully captured from the webcam using OpenCV. The HandTrackingModule is
                effective in detecting hands within the video stream, allowing for the simultaneous detection of up to two hands (maxHands=2) and
                the ClassificationModule, utilizing the pre-trained CNN, accurately recognizes 26 ASL gestures corresponding to the English
                alphabet where hand photographs are taken and processed at the specified dimensions of 300x300 pixels (imgSize = 300).
                Bounding boxes (bbox) are successfully extracted from the original video frame for each detected hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Grocery e-commerce Website:</strong>A web based project using HTML, CSS and JS where users can place grocery orders.</li>
